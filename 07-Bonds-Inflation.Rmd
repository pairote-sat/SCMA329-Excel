# Bonds and Inflation

## Zero-Coupon Bonds

The simplest type of bond is the one without coupons. Such bonds are
referred to as **zero-coupon bonds**. More precisely,

An **$n$-year zero-coupon bond** is a fixed interest security, redeemed
at par with term $n$ and no coupon payments.

*What cash flows will an investor receive if the investor
holds an $n$-year zero-coupon per 100 THB face value until maturity? (Here
we let $P_n$ denote the price now of the $n$-year zero-coupon)*

To calculate the rate of return of buying a bond and holding it until
maturity, it is simply the discount rate that equate the present value
of the investment to its costs (or bond price). Recall that $P_n$
denotes the price now of the $n$-year zero-coupon with FV face value and
$y_n$ is the **yield to maturity**. The yield to maturity satisfies the
following equation $$\begin{aligned}
    P_n = \frac{FV}{(1+y_n)^n}.\end{aligned}$$ Hence,
$$y_n = \left(\frac{FV}{P_n}\right)^{1/n} - 1.$$

*(Excel) Download the yields to maturity of zero-coupon
bonds per THB 100 face value with the terms ranging from 0.08 to 47
years from the following website (as of 11/03/2020)*

*<http://www.thaibma.or.th/EN/Market/YieldCurve/Zero.aspx>*

1.  *Using the zero-coupon rates provided from the given website, plot
    the interest rates (i.e. yield to maturity) as a function of their
    maturities at any point in time. Give a brief explanation regarding
    to the shape of the plot.*

2.  *Determine the price now of the zero-coupon bond corresponding to
    the given yields to maturity.*

**Notes**
1.  We will often refer to the yield to maturity of the appropriate
    maturity, zero-coupon risk-free bond as the **risk-free interest
    rate**.

2.  The term **spot interest rate** is also used to refer to these
    risk-free interest rate.

3.  All $n$-year risk-free investments must earn the same return as the
    risk-free interest rate.

4.  The plot in Example \@ref(exm:yieldCurve)  is known as the **yield curve**, which plots
    the risk-free interest rate for different maturities.

5.  The yield curve is also called the **term structure of interest
    rates**.

6.  Yield curves very from day to day, and could be increasing, or
    decreasing in shape, or even humped, depending on market
    expectations.

Bond pricing using yield to maturity
------------------------------------

Recall that a tax-exempt investor receives the full amount of the coupon
and redemption payments. The price of an $n$ year fixed interest bond
which pays coupons of $D$ per annum payable $p$ thly in arrears and has
redemption amount $R$ is $$P = D a_{\angln}^{(p)} + R v^n$$ at rate $i$
per annum.

In practice, we can calculate by using a suitable time period, for
example a period of half a year as shown in the previous examples. Then
the formula can be written as
$$P = \frac{D}{2} a_{\angl{2n}} + R v^{2n}$$

::: {.example}
*(Excel) (Modified from Financial Modeling Using Excel
and VBA) The bond price is the present value of its expected future
cashflows discounted at a rate appropriate for its risk. There are five
key bond variables including price, redemption rate, coupon rate,
remaining life, and discount rate, and any four of them determine the
fifth. Add suitable spinners to the annual coupon rate and yield to
maturity so that you can study how these variables affect the price of a
bond. (Hint :
<https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-scroll-bar-or-spin-button>*

1.  *Create an Excel model to calculate the price of a bond given its
    yield to maturity, redemption rate, annual coupon rate, frequency of
    coupon payments, and remaining life (and also face value). Make all
    of these input variables so that a user can use the model to value
    any bond for which these data are available.*

2.  *Create a chart to show how the price of a bond grows or declines to
    redemption amount as it approaches maturity.*
:::

::: {.example}
*Make a copy of your Excel worksheet for bond pricing
calculation. The Excel model can be used to investigate how the value of
a bond changes with changes in the values of the other variables.*

*Use the spinner to change the yield to maturity from a value less than
the coupon rate to a value greater than the coupon rate to see how the
valuation curve changes. What conclusion can you make regarding the
change in the values of the bond in respect of the change of the yield
to maturity? Write your conclusion in cell D1.*

*Change the coupon rate to zero for a zero-coupon bond and notice that
the longer the remaining life, the lower the price of the bond. Then use
the spinner to vary the yields to maturity to see how valuation curve
changes. What conclusion can you make regarding the changes occurring?
Write your conclusion in cell D1.*

Interest rate risk and bond prices
----------------------------------

While the effect of time on bond prices is predictable, unpredictable
changes in interest rates will also affect bond prices. Further, bonds
with different characteristics will respond differently to changes in
interest rates---some bonds will react more strongly than others.

::: {.example}
*Consider a 10-year coupon bond and a 30-year coupon
bond, both with 10% annual coupons and redeemable at par.*

1.  *By what percentage will the price of each bond change if its yield
    to maturity increases from 5% to 6%? Answer in cells D1 and D2
    respectively.*

2.  *Plot the values of the 10-year and 30-year coupon bonds as the
    function of yield to maturity. Which of the bonds is more sensitive
    to a change in the yield? Why?*
:::

Inflation
---------

Create an Excel model to calculate the required quantities as given in
the following questions. Look for the sheet CPI containing the CPI index
from the Bureau of Trade and Economic Indices.

::: {.example}
*A 5-year bond with nominal value of à¸¿100 was issued in
1/1/2013. The coupon rate was 8% p.a. payable yearly in arrears. The
redemption was 100% after 5 years. The bond was issued at 100%.*

1.  *Calculate the monetary yield to a non-tax paying investor.*

2.  *With reference to the monthly CPI, calculate the real yield to a
    non-tax paying investor.*

3.  *Assuming that over the period of the transaction the annual rate of
    inflation will be constant and equal to 3.01%, calculate the
    investor?s real yield on the transaction.*
