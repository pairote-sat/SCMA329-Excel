A person borrows a sum of $5,000 and agrees to pay this back at the end of 1 year with interest calculated at an effective rate of 10% per annum. Calculate the amount to be repaid for the loan. You want to have $1000 in 2 years and $2000 in 4 years. How much should you deposit now into an account earning the effective rate of 5.75% semiannually? Katy deposits 100 into a saving account which pays interest at \\(i\\) per quarter effective. At the same time, Taylor deposits 500 into a different saving account which pays a simple interest at an annual rate of \\(i\\). During the last 3 months of the 4th year, they both earn the same amount of interest. Calculate \\(i\\). An ordinary annuity is a series of equal payments made at the end of consecutive periods over a fixed length of time. Draw a timeline for the following annuity having cashflow of 1 unit at the end of each of the next n time units. Draw a timeline to illustrate this insurance benefit: Whole Life Insurance - payable immediately on death - has following conditions: death benefit (sum insured) of 1 payable immediately on the death of an individual currently aged x for death occurring any time in the future.

The annual amount of the annuity will be $ 2,400 for the first 10 years and $ 3,600 for the next 15 years, after which payment will cease. Assume that the effective rate of interest is 2% per annum. Assume that the effective rate of interest will be 3% for 5 years from now, 4% for the next 5 years and 5% thereafter. Calculate the following values: The present value of an annuity of $ 1,000 per annum, payable in arrear for 15 years. The present value of an annuity due of $ 500 per annum, payable at the beginning of the year for 20 years. The accumulation value of an increasing annuity payable yearly in arrear for 30 years.

You borrow $ 240,000 from a bank to be repaid by the end of 5 years. Assume that the interest rate is 4% per annum. Consider the following four possible options for the loan to be repaid. Calculate the amount of the repayments to repay if you choose to repay the loan as late as possible. You may choose to repay interest only during the 5 years term of loan and repay the capital at the end of the term. Calculate interest to be repaid and draw the timeline to illustrate the cashflows for the repayment of the loan. Calculate the amount X of level instalments to repay the loan which will be paid at the end of each year for 5 years and draw the timeline to illustrate the cashflows for the repayment of the loan. Calculate the amount Y of level instalments to repay the loan which will be paid at the end of each month for 5 years and draw the timeline to illustrate the cashflows for the repayment of the loan. Instalment is a sum of money due as one of several equal payments for something, spread over an agreed period of time. A person now age 30 has received a pension from a company. When he retires at age 60, he will be paid on each birthday from the 60 to the 85th inclusive. The first annual payment will be half of his salary when he retires, and payments will then increase by 2% compounding each year. Currently, he receive a salary of $ 20,000 and will increase by 3% each year compounding in line with inflation. Assume that the effective rate of interest will be 4% for the next 20 years and 5% thereafter. Calculate the present value now of this pension.
