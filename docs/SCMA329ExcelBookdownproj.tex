\section{Dates and date functions}\label{dates-and-date-functions}}

Dates and date functions will be discussed in this section. Depending on
the system setting, the dates used in this section corresponds to the
U.S. setting, i.e.~month/day/year. Thus, 7/1/2017 corresponds to 1 July
2017.

The following date formats are recognized by Excel:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  7/1/2017, 7/1/17
\item
  7-1-2017, 7-1-17,
\item
  7-1/2017, 7-1/17,
\item
  July 1, 2017
\item
  1-Jul-2017
\end{itemize}

if the date input is without the year, then it is the date on the
current year, i.e.~7-1, 7/1, July 1, Jul 1, corresponds to 1 July 2018.

\hypertarget{inconsistent-date-entries}{%
\subsection{Inconsistent date entries}\label{inconsistent-date-entries}}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-1}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-1}

\emph{What will be the output when we enter dates by using the
following two digits for the years:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{7/1/01}
\item
  \emph{7/1/60}
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

Excel interprets two digit years between 00 and 29 as 21st century
dates, and two digit years between 30 and 99 as 20th century dates.

\hypertarget{date-serial-number}{%
\subsection{Date serial number}\label{date-serial-number}}

Excel stores dates as sequential serial numbers so that they can be used
in calculations. For example,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  1 January 1900 is serial number 1,
\item
  1 January 2018 is serial number 43101 because it is 43101 days after
  1 January 1900.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{date-functions}{%
\subsection{Date functions}\label{date-functions}}

The list of date functions can be seen by choosing

\textbf{Formulas \(\rightarrow\) Function Library \(\rightarrow\) Function Library \(\rightarrow\) Date \& Time}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Function} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
\endhead
DATE & Returns the serial number of a particular date \\
DATEVALUE & Converts a date in the form of text to a serial number \\

DAYS & Returns the number of days between two dates \\
WEEKDAY & Converts a serial number to a day of the week \\
NETWORKDAYS & Returns the difference between two dates, excluding weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays) \\
WORKDAY & Returns a number that represents a date that is the indicated number of working days before or after a date (the starting date) \\
EDATE & Returns the serial number that represents the date that is the indicated number of months before or after a specified date \\
EOMONTH & Returns the serial number for the last day of the month that is the indicated number of months before or after a specified date \\
YEARFRAC & Returns a decimal value that represents fractional years between two dates \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

More detailed examples are also given in the Excel lab.

\hypertarget{working-with-texts}{%
\section{Working with Texts}\label{working-with-texts}}

In this section, we will see how Excel handles text strings, and how we
use text functions to modify and manipulate text strings. First, we give
a note regarding texts in Excel.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A single cell can hold up to 32,000 characters. In case you need to
  display a lot of text in a worksheet, then use a text box (Choose
  Insert \(\Rightarrow\) Text \(\Rightarrow\) Text Box). It will be easier
  to edit texts in the text box than in cells.
\item
  Sometimes, when you download numerical data from the internet or
  database, the imported values are treated as text, i.e.~when you do
  a calculation with such data, you will get a \#VALUE error. When a
  number is not treated as a number, there will be an error indicator.
  By clinking to expand a list of options, you can then convert it to
  the number.
\item
  Another issue that you may encounter is about currency that uses
  different characters to separate thousands or decimals.
  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{text-functions}{%
\subsection{Text functions}\label{text-functions}}

The following Excel functions can be used to modify text strings in the
format you need. Alternatively, one may extract data by using the
Convert Text To Columns Wizard (choose Data \(\Rightarrow\) Text To
Columns).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  RIGHT(text,{[}n{]}) returns the last \(n\) characters in a text string.
\item
  LEFT(text, {[}n{]}) returns the first \(n\) characters in a text string.
\item
  MID(text, start\_num, num\_chars) returns num\_char characters from a
  text string, starting at start\_num.
\item
  TRIM(text) removes all spaces from text except for single spaces
  between words. Use TRIM when text strings have irregular spacing.
\item
  LEN(text) returns the number of characters in a text string.
\item
  FIND(find\_text, within\_text, {[}start\_num{]}) return the location at
  or after character start\_num of the first character of find\_text in
  within\_text.
\item
  SEARCH(find\_text, within\_text, {[}start\_num{]}) has the same syntax as
  FIND, but it is not case sensitive.
\item
  SUBSTITUTE(text, old\_text, new\_text, {[}instance\_num{]}) is used to
  replace new\_text for old\_text in a text string. Here Instance\_num is
  optional. It specifies which occurrence of old\_text you want to
  replace with new\_text. If you specify instance\_num, only that
  instance of old\_text is replaced. Otherwise, every occurrence of
  old\_text in text is changed to new\_text.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{character-codes}{%
\subsection{Character codes}\label{character-codes}}

Excel uses the standard ASCII character set. Therefore, each character
has its own code. For example, to get the code number of ``A'', simply
type

=CODE(``A''), which returns the code number 65.

The CHAR function reverses the role of CODE function, i.e.

=CHAR(65), which returns the letter A. The input for the CHAR function
should be a value between 1 and 255.

For the complete list of ASCII codes, please visit
\url{https://theasciicode.com.ar}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-2}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-2}

\emph{Create an Excel file to list all the first 255 ASCII
codes. It is a good idea to compare the outputs with those from the
website above.}

\end{example}

\hypertarget{determining-whether-two-string-are-identical}{%
\subsection{Determining whether two string are identical}\label{determining-whether-two-string-are-identical}}

In order to determine whether strings in cell A1 and A2 have the same
contents, we use = A1 = A2, which returns either TRUE or FALSE. Note
that the comparison is not case-sensitive.

Alternative, the function that provides an exact, case-sensitive
comparison is EXACT function.

\hypertarget{joining-two-or-more-cells}{%
\subsection{Joining two or more cells}\label{joining-two-or-more-cells}}

To join two or more cells, Excel uses an ampersand \&. For example if the
string ``the effective interest rate per annum'' is in A1 and the value of
5\% (formatted value) is in B1. Then use the formula

= A1 \& '' is '' \& B1, which returns the effective interest rate per annum
is 0.05.

A better solution is to use the TEXT function to format the value as
text as follows.

= A1 \& '' is '' \& TEXT(B1,'' 0.00\%``) , which returns the effective interest
rate per annum is 0.05.

Use \textbf{Home Format Format cells} to obtain the list of various text
formats.

For example, if A1 contains the principle of \$10,000, then

= ``The principle is'' \& TEXT(A1, '' \$\#,\#\#0''), which returns The
principle is \$10,000.

The following table gives examples that are format with TEXT function.

\begin{verbatim}
=TEXT(1234.567,"$#,##0.00")     
Currency with a thousands separator and 2 decimals, like $1,234.57. Note that Excel rounds the value to 2 decimal places.

=TEXT(TODAY(),"MM/DD/YY")
Today's date in MM/DD/YY format, like 03/14/12

=TEXT(TODAY(),"DDDD")
Today's day of the week, like Monday

=TEXT(NOW(),"H:MM AM/PM")
Current time, like 1:29 PM

=TEXT(0.285,"0.0%")
Percentage, like 28.5%

=TEXT(4.34 ,"# ?/?")
Fraction, like 4 1/3

=TRIM(TEXT(0.34,"# ?/?"))
Fraction, like 1/3. Note this uses the TRIM function to remove the leading space with a decimal value.

=TEXT(12200000,"0.00E+00")
Scientific notation, like 1.22E+07

=TEXT(1234567898,"[<=9999999]###-####;(###) ###-####")
Special (Phone number), like (123) 456-7898

=TEXT(1234,"0000000")
Add leading zeros (0), like 0001234
\end{verbatim}

The TEXT function will convert numbers to text. It is best practice to
keep your original values in one cell, and formatted number in another
cell. When you do calculation, you should refer to the cells containing
original values.

\hypertarget{interest-rate-present-values-and-cashflows}{%
\section{Interest Rate, Present Values and Cashflows}\label{interest-rate-present-values-and-cashflows}}

\hypertarget{working-with-a-single-cashflow-in-excel}{%
\subsection{Working with a single cashflow in Excel}\label{working-with-a-single-cashflow-in-excel}}

\hypertarget{how-to-calculate-the-future-value-of-a-single-cashflow}{%
\subsubsection{How to calculate the future value of a single cashflow}\label{how-to-calculate-the-future-value-of-a-single-cashflow}}

Suppose an amount \(C\) is deposited in an account that pays a fixed
interest at the rate of \(i\)\% per time units. Then after \(t\) time units,
the deposit will have accumulated to \[C (1+i)^t.\]

In Excel, the function FV calculates the future value of a single
investment (and also periodic constant payments) and a constant interest
rate.

The syntax of the function is:

\[\text{FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])},\]

where

\begin{itemize}
\item
  rate is the interest rate per period
\item
  nper is the number of periods over which the investment is made.
\item
  pmt (used for an annuity type) is the payment made each period and
  cannot change over the life of the annuity.
\item
  pv (optional) is an additional cash flow now (time 0)
\item
  fv is an additional cash flow nper periods from now.
\item
  type (optional) is an optional argument that defines whether the
  payment is made at the start or the end of the period:

  0 - the payment is made at the end of the period;

  1 - the payment is made at the start of the period.

  If the {[}type{]} argument is omitted, it takes on the default value
  of 0.
\end{itemize}

The following timeline illustrates the cashflows used for the FV
function (assuming that the payments (pmt) are made in arrears).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{SCMA329ExcelBookdownproj_files/figure-latex/tikz-ex-1} 

}

\caption{Timeline of cashflows for FV function}\label{fig:tikz-ex}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Note} For a single cash flow, we set pmt argument to be 0, as there are no
ongoing payments after the initial investment.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-3}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-3}

\emph{You plan to invest today with an interest rate of 3\% per
year effective. How much money will you accumulate at the end of 2
years?}

\end{example}

\textbf{Solution:} The accumulation of today in 2 years can be calculated by Excel as
\[\text{FV}(3\%, 2, 0, -100).\]

\hypertarget{how-to-calculate-the-present-value-of-a-single-cashflow}{%
\subsubsection{How to calculate the present value of a single cashflow}\label{how-to-calculate-the-present-value-of-a-single-cashflow}}

Similarly, the present value of a future cashflow \(C\) required at time
\(t\) time units at a fixed interest of \(i\)\% per time units can be
calculated as \[\frac{C}{(1+i)^t}.\] In Excel, the function PV
calculates the present value of a single investment (and also periodic
constant payments) and a constant interest rate. The syntax of the
function is:

\[\text{PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])}\] where fv is an additional
cash flow nper periods from now.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-4}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-4}

\emph{How much should you deposit into the account with an
interest of 8\% so that 10 years from now its value would be ?}

\end{example}

\textbf{Solution:}
The present value of today in 10 years can be calculated by Excel as
\[\text{PV}(8\%, 10, 0, -1000).\]

\hypertarget{present-values-of-a-series-of-cashflows}{%
\subsection{Present values of a series of cashflows}\label{present-values-of-a-series-of-cashflows}}

Consider a series of cashflows defined by

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  the times of payments (cashflows), denoted by \(t_1, t_2, \ldots,\)
  and
\item
  the amount of payments, denoted by \(C_{r}\) (in short for \(C_{t_r}\)),
  which will be paid at time \(t_r\), for \(r = 1,2, \ldots\). The amounts
  can be positive or negative
\end{enumerate}

The present value at any time \(t\) of this series of cashflow is
\[PV(t) = \sum_{r=1}^\infty C_r (1 + i)^{t - t_r} = \sum_{r=1}^\infty C_r v^{t _r - t}\]
where \(i\) is the effective rate of interest and \(v = 1/(1+i)\).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{SCMA329ExcelBookdownproj_files/figure-latex/tikz-ex2-1} 

}

\caption{Timeline of a series of cashflows}\label{fig:tikz-ex2}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Notes}
1. At a fixed effective rate of interest, the original series of
cashflows is equivalent to a single payment of amount \(PV(t)\) at
time \(t\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  If two different series of cashflows have the same \(PV\) at one time
  at a given effective rate of interest, then they have the same \(PV\)
  at any time at that effective rate of interest.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{level-annuities-certain}{%
\subsubsection{Level Annuities certain}\label{level-annuities-certain}}

An \emph{annuity} is a regular series of payments (cashflows). When the
payments are certain which are payable for a definite period of time, we
call it an \emph{annuity certain}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the payments are made at the end of each time period, they are
  paid \emph{in arrear}.
\item
  Otherwise, payments are made at the beginning of each time period,
  they are pain \emph{in advance}.
\item
  An annuity paid in advance is also known as an \emph{annuity due}
\item
  If each payment is for the same amount, this is a \emph{level} annuity.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-5}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-5}

\emph{Let \(i\) be the constant effective rate of interest per
time unit. In Excel, one can calculate the accumulated value of a level
annuity certain having cashflow of pmt unit at the end of each of the
next \(n\) time units by \[\text{FV}(i\%, n, pmt, 0).\] The cashflows of
this annuity is shown in the timeline below.}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{SCMA329ExcelBookdownproj_files/figure-latex/tikz-ex3-1} 

}

\caption{Level Annuity Certain}\label{fig:tikz-ex3}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Note}
\emph{The last argument of the above syntax, {[}pv{]} (optional) which is an
additional cash flow now (at time 0), has been set to 0.}

\end{example}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-6}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-6}

\emph{Let \(i\) be the constant effective rate of interest per
time unit. In Excel, one can calculate the present value at time 0 of a
level annuity certain having cashflow of pmt unit at the end of each of
the next \(n\) time units by \[\text{PV}(i\%, n, pmt, 0).\]}

\end{example}

The timeline of these cashflows is shown in the figure below:

\hypertarget{lookup-formulas-and-data-tables}{%
\section{Lookup Formulas and Data Tables}\label{lookup-formulas-and-data-tables}}

\hypertarget{lookup-function}{%
\subsection{Lookup function}\label{lookup-function}}

Lookup function can be used to return (or retrieve) a value from a table
or a range of data. For example, use lookup function to find some
information such as date of birth, address etc. from a customer
database. Two useful lookup functions are \texttt{VLOOKUP} and \texttt{HLOOKUP}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \texttt{VLOOKUP} function searches a value in the first column and
  returns a value in the same row from a column you specify in the
  table or array.
\item
  The \texttt{HLOOKUP} function searches a value in the top row and returns a
  value in the same column from a row you specify in the table or
  array.
\end{itemize}

The syntaxes for the \texttt{LOOKUP} functions are

\texttt{=VLOOKUP(lookup\ value,\ range\ containing\ the\ lookup\ value,\ the\ column\ number\ in\ the\ range\ containing\ the\ return\ value,\ {[}range\_lookup{]})}.

\texttt{=VLOOKUP(lookup\_value,\ table\_array,\ col\_index\_num,\ {[}range\_lookup{]})}.

\texttt{=HLOOKUP(lookup\_value,\ table\_array,\ row\_index\_num,\ {[}range\_lookup{]})}.

The \texttt{{[}range\_lookup{]}} is an optional which can be specified as \texttt{TRUE} for
approximate match or \texttt{FALSE} for an exact match.

\textbf{Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The EXCEL \texttt{LOOKUP} functions treat empty cells in the result range as
  \textbf{zeros}.
\item
  If the range\_lookup is \texttt{FALSE} and an exact match is not found, the
  function returns \#N/A.
\item
  If the range\_lookup is \texttt{TRUE} or omitted, the first column of the
  \texttt{VLOOKUP} table must be in ascending order. If lookup\_value is smaller
  than the the smallest value in the first column of the table\_array,
  then the function returns \#N/A.
\item
  Use \texttt{IFERROR} function to avoid the return \#N/A. Use the following
  syntax

  \texttt{=IFERROR(value,\ value\_if\_error)}

  (for example, \texttt{=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(...),"Value\ is\ not\ availble"} )
\item
  The wildcard character * and ? can be used when the range\_lookup
  argument is text.
\item
  The wildcard character ? refers to any single character, for example
  "analy?e" finds "analyse" and "analyze".
\item
  The wildcard character * refers to any number of characters, for
  example "bio*" finds "biology" and "biotechnology".
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-9}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-9}

Import SET Index historical daily data starting from 1 January 2020 up
to now from
\url{https://www.investing.com/indices/thailand-set-historical-data}. Use
\texttt{LOOKUP} function to create the table showing

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  the closing price on the first working day of each month (not
  including holidays).
\item
  the closing price on the last working day of each month (not
  including holidays).
\end{enumerate}

Hint: use

\texttt{=WORKDAY(DATE(YEAR(A1),MONTH(A1),1)-1,1)} to return the first working day
of a month and

\texttt{=WORKDAY(DATE(YEAR(A1),MONTH(A1)+1,1),-1)} to return the last working day
of a month.

\end{example}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-10}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-10}

Use the SET Index historical data above. On your selected cells, find
the lowest and highest closing prices and the dates when those occurred
(sorting data is not allowed).

\end{example}

\hypertarget{match-and-index-functions}{%
\subsection{MATCH and INDEX functions}\label{match-and-index-functions}}

The \texttt{MATCH} and \texttt{INDEX} functions are often used together to perform
lookups.

The \texttt{MATCH} function returns the relative position of a specified item in
a range of cells. For example, if the range A1:A3 contains the values 2,
4 and 6, then the formula

\texttt{=MATCH(4,A1:A3,0)} returns the number 2, i.e.~the second item in the
range.

The syntax for MATCH is

\texttt{=MATCH(lookup\_value,\ lookup\_array,\ {[}match\_type{]})}

The optional argument is match\_type consisting of 3 values, \(-1\), 0 and
1, that specify how the match is determined.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If match\_type = 1 or omitted, then \texttt{MATCH} finds the largest value
  less than or equal to lookup\_value where lookup\_array must be in
  \textbf{ascending order}.
\item
  If match\_type = 0, then \texttt{MATCH} finds the \textbf{first value exactly equal
  to} lookup\_value.
\item
  If match\_type = \(-1\), then MATCH finds the smallest value greater
  than or equal to lookup\_value where lookup\_array must be in
  \textbf{descending order}.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{INDEX} function returns a value from within a table or range. The
syntax for INDEX is

\texttt{=INDEX(array,\ row\_num,\ {[}column\_num{]})}

If array contains only one row or column, the corresponding row\_num or
column\_num argument is optional.

\subsection{Data tables}\label{data-tables}}

Data tables allows you to create a table of values from

\begin{itemize}
\item
  a formula as one or two variables from the formula are varied, and
\item
  more formulas for various values of a single input cell.
\end{itemize}

As a result, you can examine a range of possible values when one or two
variables are systematically changed. For example, a data table can be
used to display the amount your investment will grow to for various
numbers of compounding.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-11}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-11}

An amount of \(P\) is invested for \(n\) years at a nominal interest rate of
i\%. Create a worksheet to calculate the effective annual interest rate
you will earn and the accumulation at time \(n\) years for various numbers
of compounding periods per year including

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  annual compounding
\item
  semi-annual compounding
\item
  quarterly compounding
\item
  monthly compounding
\item
  bi-weekly compounding
\item
  weekly compounding
\item
  daily compounding
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\hypertarget{model-formulation}{%

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Set up input variables:} Referring to the corresponding excel
  file, create the labels for the input variables and enter the values
  in cells B4:B7.
\item
  \textbf{Calculate the output values:} The effective annual interest rate
  \(i\%\) which is equivalent to the given nominal rate \(i^{(p)}\)
  convertible \(p\) times a year can be calculated by
  \[i = \left(1 + \frac{i^{(p)}}{p} \right)^p - 1.\] Hence, the value
  of the investment at time \(n\) years is \[FV = P (1 + i)^n.\] The
  output values are calculated and placed in cells B10 and B11,
  respectively.
\item
  \textbf{Set up data table (a one-input data table) :}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Create the labels and values for different compounding
    frequencies.
  \item
    In cells C16 and D16, create the references to cells B10 and
    B11, which are the effective annual interest rate and future
    value of investment, respectively.

    The positions of the cells C16 and D16, the formulas used to
    calculate the required values, are \textbf{one row above and to the
    right} of the column of values. The data table is
    column-oriented because the variable values are in a column,
    B17:B23 in this example.
  \item
    Select the range of cells that contains the formulas and values
    that you want to substitute, i.e.~the range B16:D23.
  \item
    Choose Data
    What-If Analysis Data table. Then type the cell reference for
    the input cell, cell B5 in this case, in the \textbf{Column input
    cell} because the data table is column-oriented. Click OK and
    Excel will complete the data table.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A new formula can be added to the existing one-variable data table
  by typing the new formula in a blank cell to the right of the
  existing formula(s) in the top row of the data table. Then repeat
  Step 3.4 as given above.
\item
  The contents of the data table are generated with a multicell array
  formula (details will be discussed in a subsequent section):

  \texttt{\{=TABLE(,B5)\}}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-12}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-12}

Suppose you borrow \(L\) from a bank to be repaid by the end of \(n\) years
at an interest rate of \(i\%\) per annum effective. If you agree to repay

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Create a model to calculate the amount of annual instalments \(X\) for
  various values of number of instalments \(n\) and interest rate of
  \(i\%\) per annum effective.
\item

  The amount to be repaid for the loan is 5000(1.1) = 5500.
\item
  Let \(X\) be the amount to be deposited now.
  \[X = \frac{1000}{(1.0575)^4} + \frac{2000}{(1.0575)^8} = 2078.36. \]
\item
  At time 3.75 years, Katy has a balance of \(100(1+i)^{15}\). The interest on this balance over the next 3 months is \(100(1+i)^{15}\cdot i\).
  Taylor earns simple interest on the original amount which is equal to \(500i\cdot\frac{3}{12}\). Therefore, we solve for \(i\) from the following equation:
  \[ 100(1+i)^{15}\cdot i = 500i\cdot\frac{3}{12},\] which gives \(i = 0.014987.\)
\item
  The timeline for the following annuity having cashflow of 1 unit at the end of each of the next \(n\) time units is given in the figure below:

  (More details in the course ``Life Contingencies I''). We need to define a random variable \(T_x\) = the remaining future life time of a life aged \(x\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{SCMA329ExcelBookdownproj_files/figure-latex/tikz-sol2-1} \end{center}

The quantity of interest is the present value of the death benefit assuming the interest rate of \(i\%\) p.a. effective. It is also a random variable,
\[PV = \frac{1}{(1+i)^{T_x}}.\] It turns out that the premium rate of this whole life insurance is \(E[PV]\), the expected value of the present value, \(PV\).

  The annual yield of this investment \(i\) is the solution of the equation of value:

  If we solve using software, we get \(i = 4.2394551%
  \). Instead of using software, you can also use linear interpolation to approximate the solution.
\item
  Working in time unit of half year, the equation of value is
  \[ f(i) = -5000(1+i)^{12 \times 2} + 300 s^i_{24} = 0. \]
  The yield \(i\) per half year is \(i = 3.1491266\%\) and hence the annual yield is \(6.397423\%.\)
\item
  The equation of value is
  \[ f(i) = -100(1+i)^{7} + 20 s^i_{7}  + 25 s^i_{4} = 0. \]

    The capital outstanding after 6th repayment (6 payments left) is
    \[ L_{6} = X a^{0.07}_{6} = 60011.68.  \]
    By extending the term of the loan by extra 2 year, the revised repayment \(X'\) can be obtained (for 8 payments) from

    This must now be repaind by only 4 annual repayments, so the new repayment \(X''\) can be obtained from
