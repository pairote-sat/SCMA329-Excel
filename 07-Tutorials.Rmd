    annually. How much will you have in three years?

6.  A person borrows a sum of \$5,000 and agrees to pay this back at the
    end of 1 year with interest calculated at an effective rate of 10%
    per annum. Calculate the amount to be repaid for the loan.

7.  You want to have \$1000 in 2 years and \$2000 in 4 years. How much
    should you deposit now into an account earning the effective rate of
    5.75% semiannually?

8.  Katy deposits 100 into a saving account which pays interest at $i$
    **per quarter** effective.

    At the same time, Taylor deposits 500 into a different saving
    account which pays a simple interest at an annual rate of $i$.

    During the last 3 months of the 4th year, they both earn the same
    amount of interest. Calculate $i$.

9.  An ordinary annuity is a series of equal payments made at the end of
    consecutive periods over a fixed length of time. Draw a timeline for
    the following annuity having cashflow of 1 unit at the end of each
    of the next n time units.

10. Draw a timeline to illustrate this insurance benefit: Whole Life
    Insurance - payable immediately on death - has following conditions:

Tutorial 3
==========

1.  Calculate the present value now of an annuity payable monthly in
    advance. The annual amount of the annuity will be \$ 2,400 for the
    first 10 years and \$ 3,600 for the next 15 years, after which
    payment will cease. Assume that the effective rate of interest is 2%
    per annum.

2.  Assume that the effective rate of interest will be 3% for 5 years
    from now, 4% for the next 5 years and 5% thereafter. Calculate the
    following values:

    1.  The present value of an annuity of \$ 1,000 per annum, payable
        in arrear for 15 years.

    2.  The present value of an annuity due of \$ 500 per annum, payable
        at the beginning of the year for 20 years.

    3.  The accumulation value of an increasing annuity payable yearly
        in arrear for 30 years. The first annual payment is \$ 100, and
        payments will be increase by \$ 100 each year.

    4.  The accumulation value of an increasing annuity payable yearly
        in advance for 18 years. The first annual payment is \$ 1,000,
        and payments will be increase by 2% each year (compound).

    5.  The present value of an annuity of \$ 200, payable in arrear for
        10 years and deferred for 3 years.

3.  You borrow \$ 240,000 from a bank to be repaid by the end of 5
    years. Assume that the interest rate is 4% per annum. Consider the
    following four possible options for the loan to be repaid.

    1.  Calculate the amount of the repayments to repay if you choose to
        repay the loan as late as possible.

    2.  You may choose to repay interest only during the 5 years term of
        loan and repay the capital at the end of the term. Calculate
        interest to be repaid and draw the timeline to illustrate the
        cashflows for the repayment of the loan.

    3.  Calculate the amount X of level instalments to repay the loan
        which will be paid at the end of each year for 5 years and draw
        the timeline to illustrate the cashflows for the repayment of
        the loan.

    4.  Calculate the amount Y of level instalments to repay the loan
        which will be paid at the end of each month for 5 years and draw
        the timeline to illustrate the cashflows for the repayment of
        the loan. **Instalment** is a sum of money due as one of several
        equal payments for something, spread over an agreed period of
        time.

4.  A person now age 30 has received a pension from a company. When he
    retires at age 60, he will be paid on each birthday from the 60 to
    the 85th inclusive. The first annual payment will be half of his
    salary when he retires, and payments will then increase by 2%
    compounding each year. Currently, he receive a salary of \$ 20,000
    and will increase by 3% each year compounding in line with
    inflation. Assume that the effective rate of interest will be 4% for
    the next 20 years and 5% thereafter. Calculate the present value now
    of this pension.

    is expected to return profits of 400,000 for 6 years a the end of
    each calendar year 2024 to 2029 inclusive. Calculate the yield of
    this investment. ANS = 5.7285486%

6.  (Modified from CT1 2014 IFoA Exam)

    An investor is considering two projects, Project A and Project B.
    Project A involves the investment of 2,000,000 in a retail outlet.
    Rent is received quarterly in arrear for 25 years, at an initial
    rate of 100,000 per annum. It is assumed that the rent will increase
    at a rate of 5% per annum compound, but with increases taking place
    every five years. Maintenance and other expenses are incurred
    quarterly in arrear, at a rate of 12,000 per annum. The retail
    outlet reverts to its original owner after 25 years for no payment.

    Project B involves the purchase of an office building for 1,000,000.
    The rent is to be received quarterly in advance at an initial rate
    of 85,000 per annum. It is assumed that the rent will increase to
    90,000 per annum after 20 years. There are no maintenance or other
    expenses. After 25 years the property reverts to its original owner
    for no payment.

    Calculate the annual effective internal reate of return for both
    Projects A and B. Which project is preferable?

# Solutions to Tutorial 1

1. The solutions to each question are as follows:
    
    1. $5000 (1.075)^4 = 6677.345703$ 
    2. Let $i\%$ be the annual rate effective equivalent to $3\%$ per quarter-effective, $i = (1.03)^4 - 1$. 
    Hence, the accumulation is
    $$800(1+i)^{2.7} = 800(1.03)^{4\times2.7} = 1100.859802.$$
    3. Let $j\%$ be the monthly rate effective equivalent to $4.25\%$ per half-year effective, $j = (1.0425)^{2/12} - 1$. 
    Hence, the accumulation is
    $$10000(1.0425)^{(2/12)\times27} = 12059.86056.$$

2. The solutions to each question are as follows:
      1. $\frac{1000}{1.075} = 930.232558$.
      2. $\frac{100}{(1.03)^7} = 81.309151$.
      3. Let $j\%$ be the quarterly rate effective equivalent to         $4.25\%$ per half-year effective, $j = (1.0425)^{2/4} - 1$. 
      Hence, the present value is
      $$10000\times (1+j)^{-5} = 10000(1.0425)^{-(5/2)} = 9011.764643.$$

3. The solutions to each question are as follows:
      
      1. 0.3274%
      2. 3.1988%

4. The solutions to each question are as follows:
      
      1. 500(1.04)(1.05)(1.06) =578.76
      2. $2000(1.04)^{3/4}(1.05)(1.06)^{3/4} =2259.299$
      3. (1.04)(1.05)(1.06) = 1.15752
      
5. The account balance in 3 years is $3000(1.025)^{3} = 3230.67$.

6. The amount to be repaid for the loan is 5000(1.1) = 5500.

7. Let $X$ be the amount to be deposited now. 
      $$X = \frac{1000}{(1.0575)^4} + \frac{2000}{(1.0575)^8} = 2078.36. $$
      
8. At time 3.75 years, Katy has a balance of $100(1+i)^{15}$. The interest on this balance over the next 3 months is  $100(1+i)^{15}\cdot i$.
Taylor earns simple interest on the original amount which is equal to $500i\cdot\frac{3}{12}$. Therefore, we solve for $i$ from the following equation:
$$ 100(1+i)^{15}\cdot i = 500i\cdot\frac{3}{12},$$ which gives $i = 0.014987.$

The quantity of interest is the present value of the death benefit assuming the interest rate of $i\%$ p.a. effective. It is also a random variable,
  $$PV = \frac{1}{(1+i)^{T_x}}.$$ It turns out that the premium rate of this whole life insurance is $E[PV]$, the expected value of the present value, $PV$.

    2. $5000A(0.5,2.75) = 5000(1.03)(1.04)^{2.5} (1.02)^{9} = 6788.786068$
    3. We first find the rate $j\%$ per month effective that is equivalent to the rate of $4\%$ per half-year effective.
    $$j = (1.04)^{1/6} - 1 = 0.00656.$$
    The accumulated value is $100A(1+2/12, 3 + 7/12 ) = 100(1+j)^{10}(1.02)^{19} = 155.522118.$

4. The solutions to each question are as follows:

# Solutions to Tutorial 3



1. Let $j$ be the effective rate per month equivalent to $i = 2$%. We have
  $$ j = (1.02)^{1/12}  - 1= 0.001652. $$
Hence, 

$$ PV(0) = 200 \ddot{a}^{j}_{120} + 300 \ddot{a}^{j}_{180} \left( \frac{1}{1.02} \right)^{10} = 60148.03. $$

2. The solutions to each question are as follows:

    1. The cashflows have been splitted into three periods: (a) from time point 0-5, (b) 5-10 and (c) time point 10 onward.
    $$PV(0) = 1000 ( a^{3\%}_{5} + 1.03^{-5} a^{4\%}_{5} +  1.03^{-5} 1.04^{-5} a^{5\%}_{5}) = 11489.49  $$

    2. We have
    $$PV(0) = 500 ( \ddot{a}^{3\%}_{5} + 1.03^{-5} \ddot{a}^{4\%}_{5} +  1.03^{-5} 1.04^{-5} \ddot{a}^{5\%}_{10}) = 7229.67  $$
    
    3. The accumuated value is
    $$100 (Is)^{3\%}_{5} (1.04)^5 (1.05)^{20} + \left[100 (Is)^{4\%}_{5} + 500 s^{4\%}_{5} \right] (1.05)^{20}  + \left[100 (Is)^{5\%}_{20} + 1000 s^{5\%}_{20} \right]= 78929.01  $$
    
    4. Let $i_1 = 3\%, i_2 = 4\%$ and $i_3 = 5\%$. The accumuated value is given by
    $$\begin{aligned} 
    V(18) &= \left[1000(1+i_1)^5 + 1000(1.02)(1+i_1)^4 + 1000(1.02)^2(1+i_1)^3 + \ldots + 1000(1.02)^4(1+i_1)\right](1.04)^5(1.05)^8   \\
    &+ \left[1000(1.02)^5(1+i_2)^5 + 1000(1.02)^6(1+i_2)^4 + 1000(1.02)^7(1+i_2)^3 + \ldots + 1000(1.02)^9(1+i_2)\right](1.05)^8   \\
    &+ \left[1000(1.02)^{10}(1+i_3)^8 + 1000(1.02)^{11}(1+i_3)^7 + 1000(1.02)^{12}(1+i_3)^6 + \ldots + 1000(1.02)^{17}(1+i_3)\right]  \\
    &= 1000(1.02)^5 \left[ \left(\frac{1+i_1}{1.02}\right)^5   + \left(\frac{1+i_1}{1.02}\right)^4 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1+i_1}{1.02}\right) \right](1.04)^5(1.05)^8 \\
    &+ 1000(1.02)^{10} \left[ \left(\frac{1+i_2}{1.02}\right)^5   + \left(\frac{1+i_2}{1.02}\right)^4 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1+i_2}{1.02}\right) \right](1.05)^8 \\
     &+ 1000(1.02)^{18} \left[ \left(\frac{1+i_3}{1.02}\right)^8   + \left(\frac{1+i_3}{1.02}\right)^7 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1+i_3}{1.02}\right) \right] 
    \end{aligned}$$
Let $1+j_1  = \frac{1+i_1}{1.02}$. Then, $j_1 = 0.009804$ and 
$$ \left[ \left(\frac{1+i_1}{1.02}\right)^5   + \left(\frac{1+i_1}{1.02}\right)^4 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1+i_1}{1.02}\right) \right] = \frac{(1+j_1)^5 - 1}{j_1/(1+j_1)} = 5.148995.$$
Let $1+j_2  = \frac{1+i_2}{1.02}$. Then, $j_2 = 0.019608$ and 
$$ \left[ \left(\frac{1+i_2}{1.02}\right)^5   + \left(\frac{1+i_2}{1.02}\right)^4 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1+i_2}{1.02}\right) \right] = 5.301921.$$
Let $1+j_3  = \frac{1+i_3}{1.02}$. Then, $j_3 = 0.029412$ and 
$$ \left[ \left(\frac{1+i_3}{1.02}\right)^8   + \left(\frac{1+i_3}{1.02}\right)^7 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1+i_3}{1.02}\right) \right]  = 9.134790.$$
Therefore, $V(18) = 32814.45$.

    5. The present value is 
    
$$\begin{aligned}
    PV(0) &= \left( \frac{200}{(1.03)^4} + \frac{200}{(1.03)^5}\right) + 200 a^{0.04}_5 (1.03)^{-5} + 200 a^{0.05}_{3} (1.03)^{-5} (1.04)^{-5} \\
    &= 350.2192 + 768.0362 + 386.1574 = 1504.413
\end{aligned}$$

3. The solutions to each question are as follows:

    1. $240000 (1.04)^5 = 291996.7$
    2. The interest amounts are $0.04\times 240000 = 9600.$
    3. By the Principle of Equivalence, we have
    $$ 240000 = X a^{0.04}_{5}. $$
    This gives X = 53910.51.
    4. Level installments are payable monthly, which follows
    $$ 240000 = Y a^{j}_{60}, $$
    where $j = (1.04)^{1/12} - 1$. This gives Y = 4412.23.
    
    
4. The person retires in 30 years, when his salary is expected to be 
$20000 \times (1.03)^{30} = 48545.25.$ 
The first payment will be half of this which is equal to 24272.62.
The present value at age 60 of his pension is
$$  24272.62 \times \ddot{a}^{0.029412}_{26} = 449717.9$$ (the precise value is 449719.051954).
Here we use $\frac{1.05}{1.02} = 1.029412$ and the annuity is paid from the 60th to the 85th birthday inclusive so there are 26 payments made in advance.
Therefore, the present value of this at age 30 is
$$ 449717.9 \times (1.05)^{-10} \times (1.04)^{-20} = 126002.9. $$
(the precise value is 126003.181173)



# Solutions to Tutorial 4

1. To examine whether the cashflows are equivalent, we compare their present values.

    a. The present value of single payment of amount 14,802.44 at year 10 is 
  $$ PV(0) =  \frac{14,802.44}{1.04^{10}} = 10000.$$

    b. The present value of the level annuity of 400 payable yearly in arrears for the next 10 years plus a lump sum of 10,000 is
  $$ PV(0) =  400 a^{0.04}_{10} +\frac{10000}{1.04^{10}} = 10000.$$
  
  
    c. The present value of the level annuity of 1,232.91 payable yearly in arrears for the next 10 years.
  $$ PV(0) =  1,232.91 a^{0.04}_{10}  = 10000.$$

It follows that the values of these cashflows are the same, i.e. equivalent.


2. The annual yield of this investment $i$ is the solution of the equation of value:
$$ f(i) = -2000(1+i)^8 +300 s^i_8 = 0. $$
If we solve using software, we get $i = 4.2394551%$. Instead of using software, you can also use linear interpolation to approximate the solution.

3. Working in time unit of half year, the equation of value is
$$ f(i) = -5000(1+i)^{12 \times 2} + 300 s^i_{24} = 0. $$
The yield $i$ per half year is $i = 3.1491266\%$ and hence the annual yield is $6.397423\%.$


4. The equation of value is
$$ f(i) = -100(1+i)^{7} + 20 s^i_{7}  + 25 s^i_{4} = 0. $$
The annual yield is $12.6209232\%.$

5. You are suggested to draw the time line for these cashflows. The equation of value is
$$ f(i) = -5 \ddot{s}^i_{3}(1+i)^{9}   + 4 s^i_{6} = 0. $$
The annual yield is $5.7285486\%.$




# Solutions to Tutorial 5

1. The monthly repayment can be calculated from this equation
$$ X = \frac{30000}{a^j_6} = \frac{30000}{5.931847} = 5057.45,$$
where $j = (1.04)^{1/12} - 1 = 0.003274.$

The complete loan schedule is illustrated below:

Time | Repayment | Interest Content | Capital Content | Capital Outstanding | 
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
0 | - | - | - |  30000 |
1 | $X$ | 98.21 | 4959.23 | 25040.77 |  
2 | $X$ | 81.98 | 4975.47 | 20065.30 | 
3 | $X$ | 65.69 | 4991.76 | 15073.54 | 
4 | $X$ | 49.35 | 5008.10 | 10065.44 |
5 | $X$ | 32.95 | 5024.50 | 5040.94 |
6 | $X$ | 16.50 | 5040.94 | 0 |

2. The monthly repayment can be calculated from this equation
$$ X = \frac{800000}{a^j_{120}} = \frac{800000}{88.806749} = 9008.32,$$
where $j = (1.065)^{1/12} - 1 = 0.005262.$

The capital outstanding after 95th repayment (25 payments left) is
$$ L_{95} = 9008.32 a^j_{25} = 210506.84.  $$

Hence, the interest content of the 96th repayment is
$$ j \times L_{95} = 0.005262 \times 210506.84 = 1107.62.$$
The capital content of the 96th repayment is
$$ X - 1107.62 = 7900.70. $$

3. 
    
    1. 
    a. **Extending the term of the loan by extra 2 year:** The original repayment is
$$ X = \frac{100000}{a^{0.07}_{12}} = \frac{100000}{7.942686} = 12590.20,$$
    The capital outstanding after 6th repayment (6 payments left) is
$$ L_{6} = X a^{0.07}_{6} = 60011.68.  $$
    By extending the term of the loan by extra 2 year, the revised repayment $X'$ can be obtained (for 8 payments) from
$$ X' = \frac{L_6}{a^{0.07}_{8}} = 10050.02$$

    b. **Missing the next two repayments:** From the previous result, the capital outstanding after 6th repayment $L_6 = 60011.68$. Then in 2 years, with interest at $7\%$ per annum, this accumulates to 
$$ L_6 \times (1.07)^2 = 68707.37. $$
This must now be repaind by only 4 annual repayments, so the new repayment $X''$ can be obtained from
$$ X'' = \frac{68707.37}{a^{0.07}_{4}} = 20284.35.$$

    2. The capital outstanding will accumulate (at $10\%$) to 
$$ L_6 \times (1.1)^2 = 72614.14. $$

    The new repayment amount $X'''$ is
$$X''' = \frac{72614.14}{a^{0.07}_{4}} = 21437.73.$$


    3. The new repayment amount will be 
$$\frac{72614.14}{a^{0.07}_{8}} = 12160.53.$$

4. You are suggested to draw the time line for these cashflows. Let $X$ be the level of repayment of the first 6 years ($2X$ will be repaid after this period for the last 6 years). It can be obtained from
$$ 50000 = X(a^{0.04}_6 + 2 a^{0.05}_6 (1.04)^{-6}) = 3769.34.$$

5. 

    1. Let $X$ be the first annual repayment. Then,  
$$ 40000 = X(v + v^2(1.02) + v^3(1.02)^2 + \ldots + v^{10}(1.02)^9),$$
    where $v = 1/(1.065).$ By rewriting the above equation, we have
$$ 40000 = \frac{X}{1.02}(\frac{1.02}{1.065} + \left( \frac{1.02}{1.065} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1.02}{1.065} \right)^3 + \ldots + \left( \frac{1.02}{1.065} \right)^{10}),$$

    Let $i' =  \left( \frac{1.065}{1.02} -1 \right) = 0.044118.$ Hence,
  $$ 40000 = \frac{X}{1.02} \cdot a^{i'}_{10},$$
    and $X = 5133.91.$

    2. We will calculate the  capital outstanding after 7th repayment, $L_7$ (3 payments left). We first find the amount $X_8$of the 8th repayment, 
$$X_8 = X(1.02)^7 = 5897.25.$$ 
    
    So the capital outstanding after the 7th repayment is equal to the present value of the remaining 3 repayments (see the table below).

Time |7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
Payment | $L_7 = ?$ | $X_8$ | $X_8 (1.02)$ | $X_8(1.02)^2$ |
It follows that
$$
\begin{aligned} L_7 &= X_8( v + v^2 + v^3) \\
&= \frac{X_8}{(1.02)} a^{i'}_3 \\
&= 15919.94,
\end{aligned}$$
where $v$ and $i'$ are the same as above. 
    
    
  3. The interest content of the 8th repayment is
$$ L_7 * i = 15919.94 \times 0.065 = 1034.80.$$
